# T.O.P : Library
The Odin Project's Full-Stack Javascript Path [1st assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/library) (my 5th assignment overall): build a library app

### Features required by the assignment:
- [x] User can add new book
- [x] User can remove a book
- [x] User can toggle between 'read' and 'not read' status

### Optional feature:
- [ ] Data persistence through localStorage or Firebase

### Features I implemented as extras:
- [x] Ability to add different types of media (books, movies, etc)
- [x] Color-coding of cards according to type of media

This assignment remains unfinished. The basic requirements were implemented (as seen on the list above), but some issues remain - as a display bug when the user deletes a card.

No data persistence was implemented, but some initial data (cards) are provided to help with the visualization.

A number of extra features (ability to sort, filter and search cards, as well as ability to edit an existing card) were intended from the beginning, which is reflected in the design, but have not been implemented either (so the buttons are there but don't do anything).
