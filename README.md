# T.O.P : Library
[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s 5th assignment: build a library app

### Features required by the assignment:
- [ ] User can add new book
- [ ] User can remove a book
- [ ] User can toggle between 'read' and 'not read' status

### Optional feature:
- [ ] Data persistence through localStorage or Firebase

(it seems series are the new way people consume fiction, so I made mine a library of series, instead of books)
