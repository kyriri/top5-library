### Basic 

[x] I can see one big card - that's the main card.
[x] I can see other smaller cards.
[ ] When I click a smaller card, it becomes the only main card.
[ ] I can click the main card and make it become smaller, with no main card in sight.
[x] There's a "new card" button that I can click. I can always see it.

[x] Book cards have the following fields:
- title
- author
- original language
- category (has suggestions, but accept any string)
- comment (has suggestions on things worth commenting)
- quotes

[x] Type, language and category have lists of values that include some standard ones
[ ] ...plus any custom value already on the database.

[x] The cards have a read status toggle button 
[ ] ...and cards have different colors according to this status.

[x] In the main card, all non-empty fields are showing, so it stretches down, but up to a limit, after which I can scroll the content.
[x] With uber long titles, it scrolls down as well.
[x] With super big zooming, I can still read the cards.

[x] There's a little bin icon in each card 
[ ] ...that I can click and it removes the card
[ ] ...and it prompts for confirmation. (task at https://javascript.info/arrow-functions-basics)

[ ] When I click the "new card" button it shows a card in the center of my screen 
[x] ...with fields to complete. 
[x] ...it has a "save" button
[x] ... and 'title' and 'type' are mandatory fields. 

(how to make user input safe?)

### Intermediate

[ ] I can retrieve cards I added some other day.
[ ] I can edit the cards.
[ ] Buttons can be activited by keyboard.

---
### Advanced

[x] There's a "sort cards" button
[ ] ...when I click it, it show me a list of sort options.

[ ] I can search these cards typing words. 
[ ] ...it searches all fields. 
[ ] ...while search is active, cards are shown by match relevancy (omg how to define relevance?).

[ ] The smaller cards are like tiles behind the main card, and when I click a tile, it opens it.
