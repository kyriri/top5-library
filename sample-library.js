    quotes: `— 'It's a fascinating story, but hard to believe,' Haida admitted. 
      <BR>— 'Because there's no logical explanation?'
      <BR>— 'Exactly.'
      <BR>— 'No way to prove it.'
      <BR>— 'The only way you know if it's real or not, the only way to prove it, is by actually making the deal. Isn't that how it works?'
      <BR>Midorikawa nodded. 'Exactly. Unless you take the leap, you can't prove it. And once you actually make the leap, there's no need to prove it anymore. There's no middle ground.'

    quotes: `"I'm not trying to tell you", he said, "that only educated and scholarly men are able to contribute something valuable to the world. It's not so. But I do say that educated and scholarly men, if they're brilliant and creative to begin with — which, unfortunately, is rarely the case — tend to leave infinitely more valuable records behind them than men do who are _merely_ brilliant and creative. They tend to express themselves more clearly, and they usually have a passion for following their thoughts through to the end. (...)`,

    quotes: `FLETCHER: The truth is I don’t think people understand what it is I did at Shaffer. I wasn’t there to conduct. Any idiot can move his hands and keep people in tempo. No, it’s about pushing people beyond what’s expected of them. And I believe that is a necessity. Because without it you’re depriving the world of its next Armstrong. Its next Parker. Why did Charlie Parker become Charlie Parker, Andrew?
    <BR><BR>ANDREW: Because Jo Jones threw a cymbal at him.
    <BR><BR>FLETCHER: Exactly. Young kid, pretty good on the sax, goes up to play his solo in a cutting session, fucks up -- and Jones comes this close to slicing his head off for it. He’s laughed off-stage. Cries himself to sleep that night. But the next morning, what does he do? He practices. And practices and practices. With one goal in mind: that he never ever be laughed off-stage again. A year later he goes back to the Reno, and he plays the best motherfucking solo the world had ever heard. 
    <BR><BR>Now imagine if Jones had just patted young Charlie on the head and said “Good job.” Charlie would’ve said to himself, “Well, shit, I did do a good job,” and that’d be that. No Bird. Tragedy, right? Except that’s just what people today want. The Shaffer Conservatories of the world, they want sugar. You don’t even say “cutting session” anymore, do you? No, you say “jam session”. What the fuck kind of word is that? Jam session? It’s a cutting session, Andrew, this isn’t fucking Smucker’s. It’s about weeding out the best from the worst so that the worst become better than the best. 
    <BR><BR>I mean look around you. $25 drinks, mood lighting, a little shrimp cocktail to go with your Coltrane. And people wonder why jazz is dying.... Take it from me, and every Starbucks jazz album only proves my point. There are no two words more harmful in the entire English language than “good job”.`,

      <BR>TEKLA. Nothing at all! Christians say that our actions are governed by Providence; others call it Fate; in either case, are we not free from all liability?
      <BR>
      <BR>GUSTAV. In a measure, yes; but there is always a narrow margin left unprotected, and there the liability applies in spite of all. And sooner or later the creditors make their appearance. Guiltless, but accountable!`,
